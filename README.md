Block Matrix Multiplication implementation on GPU using CUDA

This repository contatins block matrix multiplication on GPU using CUDA language. The goal of this project is to speed up conventional matrix multiplication algorithms. Instead of using square block in matrices, the blocks are rectangular, which can be modified in bmm.cu file.
